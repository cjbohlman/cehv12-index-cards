# cehv12-index-cards
My personal index cards for studying for the CEH v12 exam
Designed for memorization with spaced repitition, using a program like Anki.

There's definitely a few mistakes in these cards, and some of them can be better broken down into atomic pieces of information. Also, while numerous, these cards are not exhaustive of all the material in the courseware. I encourage you to change them as you see fit.
